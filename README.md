# Malware-with-universal-compatibility
This is a malware designed to collect data of a user through malicious code and spying on the user.

Use this very carefully.
I adjusted the code to save it to slave computer so it can't be used for malicious use and requires actual programming skills to adjust for real attacks.
This program do the following
1. Capture Screenshots
2. Capture keylogs
3. Capture photographs through camera

Best works on Windows but also works on MacOS.

For educational purposes so do not use for malicious uses

Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
