# Malware-with-universal-compatibility
This is a malware designed to collect data of a user through malicious code and spying on the user.

Use this very carefully.
I adjusted the code to save it to slave computer so it can't be used for malicious use and requires actual programming skills to adjust for real attacks.
This program do the following
1. Capture Screenshots
2. Capture keylogs
3. Capture photographs through camera

Best works on Windows but also works on MacOS.
I did not give instructions how to change the code, if you are a programmer you will know how to change it
The reason being I don't want people who just want to act like hackers and cause harm but don't know how to hack.
This is for educational purposes but a pint of twist.

Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
